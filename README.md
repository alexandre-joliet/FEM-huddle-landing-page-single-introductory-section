## My process

Quite easy challenge to do, no issue encountered.


1. Analyse of the design schema to identify the different items and how to built the right elements in the HTML file
2. Building of the structure using BEM and the semantic
3. Starting of building the style in CSS, from top to bottom
4. Polishing the desktop version
5. Building of the mobile version

NB: responsiveness between width 1440px and 375px is not done


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM methodology
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
